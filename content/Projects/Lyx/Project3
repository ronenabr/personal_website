LyX talks

During the last years, I thought several introductory and advanced LyX workshop, Both in Technion's physics department and in Haifa University CS department. In the Technion, the workshop had big success, and big portion of the graduate and undergraduate students in the Physics department are currently using LyX as their main writing tool.

Recent version of my talk can be found [here](http://ronenabr.github.io/lyx_hebrew_talk/) (in Hebrew).

We also organized small [LyX users meetup](https://github.com/daniel-vainsencher/technion-LyX) at  Technion.
