Swimming in Magnetic Field

During Spring 2010, Miri Lavie and I did a project under the supervision of [Prof. Yossi Avron](http://physics.technion.ac.il/~avron/) on *Swimming in Magnetic Field*. In our research we tried to understand swimming - the motion of body in perpendicular Magnetic field - by moving electric charges in a closed path.
