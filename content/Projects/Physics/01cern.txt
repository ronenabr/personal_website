Summer at CERN

In summer 2009, I participated the [summer students program](http://home.web.cern.ch/students-educators/summer-student-programme) in [CERN](http://www.cern.ch/), the European Organization for Nuclear Research.  During the summer, I listened to great talks, and did some research under the supervision of Ludovico Pontecorvo, in [ATLAS'](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/MuonSpectrometer)  [Muon Spectrometer](http://atlas.ch/). 

The research objective was to check for the possibility of measuring the background radiation in ATLAS' cavern using the Muon Spectrometers Monitored Drift Chambers (MDT). I studied the electronic noise fluctuations between different Muon chambers, and along different runs of the detectors. I also examined the nature of noise of specific, very noisy drift tubes.

You can find my final [Report](project/cern/ronen_cern_report.pdf) and [Slides](project/cern/ronen_cern_slides.pdf) here. Some general experience from Cern and around can be found [here](project/cern/cern_experience.html).
