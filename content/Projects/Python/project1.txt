Python Workshop for Phsicists

I taught a six-hour python workshop for Physics students at Technion. We coverd basic syntax and usage, 
and some usage of Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib and Pandas. 

Slides and notes from the workshop can be found [here](http://ronenabr.github.io/python_for_physicsits/) (Hebrew).
